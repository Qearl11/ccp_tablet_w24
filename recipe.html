        <p>My daughter learned to make these cookies at a baking camp at Zingermanns and has tweaked the recipe to fit the taste buds of her siblings.  They are extremely sugary so the salt helps to balance it.  Note, these cookies are best eaten very quickly.</p>

        <P>chocolate_chip_banana_bread.jpeg</P>
        <p>This is a tried-and-tested recipe that I have used numerous times for making the perfect chocolate chip banana bread! Not only does it help utilize the bananas that have slowly overripened at the back of the fridge, it ends up creating an incredibly delicious, and relatively healthy, dessert.</p>
        <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Cooking spray</li>
            <li>2 cups (240 g) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp. baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp. kosher salt</li>
            <li>1 large egg plus 1 egg yolk</li>
            <li>1 cup (200 g) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>1/4 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1 tsp. pure vanilla extract /li>
            <li>3 ripe bananas, mashed</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chopped toasted walnuts</li>
            <li>1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350º. Line a 9"-by-5" loaf pan with parchment and grease with cooking spray. </li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix egg, egg yolk, granulated sugar, butter, sour cream, and vanilla. Add bananas and stir until combined. Gradually add dry ingredients to banana mixture until just combined.</li>
            <li>In a separate bowl combine the flour, baking soda, cocoa powder and salt</li>
            <li>Fold in walnuts and chocolate chips and transfer to prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake bread until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Let cool 10 minutes in pan, then invert onto a wire rack and let cool completely.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Boba Milk Tea</h2>
        <h3>Origin: Taiwan</h3>
        <a href="https://tasty.co/recipe/boba-milk-tea">Source: tasty.co</a>

        <img src="images/milktea.png" width = "400" alt="boba_milk_tea">
        <P>Boba Milk Tea</P>
        <p>This classic milk tea was inspired by my experiences walking around Taiwan. Every cup of milk tea had this signature condensed milk flavor that fused perfectly with the concentrated black tea.</p>
        <h3>Recipe Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>⅓ cup water, plus more as needed</li>
            <li>¼ cup dark muscovado sugar, or brown sugar</li>
            <li>¾ cup tapioca flour, plus more for dusting</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons half & half</li>
            <li>6 black tea bags</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>3 cups ice, divided</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add the water and muscovado sugar to a medium pan over medium-high heat.Cook until the sugar dissolves and the mixture comes to a boil, 3–4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add a bit of the tapioca flour and cook, stirring constantly, until smooth. Add half of the remaining tapioca flour and stir vigorously until a sticky dough forms.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and add the remaining tapioca flour. Stir until the dough comes together in a ball (not all of the flour will be incorporated at this stage). Let cool slightly.</li>
            <li>Turn the dough out onto a clean surface. Knead until all of the flour is incorporated and the dough is smooth, adding more flour or water as needed if the dough is too sticky or too dry.</li>
            <li>Roll the dough into long, thin ropes about ¼-inch (6.35 mm) thick, cutting in half crosswise if they get too long. Cut the ropes into ¼-inch (6.35 mm) pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and place in a bowl with a bit of tapioca flour. Dust the balls with the flour to prevent them from sticking to each other.</li>
            <li>Shake off any excess flour from the tapioca pearls, then add to the boiling water. Stir to separate the pearls, then reduce the heat to medium-low. Simmer gently, stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes, until cooked through.</li>
            <li>Add the muscovado sugar and water to a small saucepan over medium heat. Cook until the sugar dissolves and the syrup reduces slightly, 5–7 minutes. Pour the syrup into a large heatproof bowl.</li>
            <li>Add the pearls to the bowl with the brown sugar syrup and let sit for 30–60 minutes./li>
            <li>In a medium pot over high heat, combine the water and tea bags. Bring to a boil, then remove the pan from the heat and let the tea cool to room temperature.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl or liquid measuring cup, whisk together the half-and-half and sweetened condensed milk until combined.</li>
            <li>Add about ⅓ cup (80 ml) boba pearls and brown sugar syrup to the bottom of each glass. Top with 1½ cups (225 grams) ice, then add ½ cup (240 ml) black tea and 3 tablespoons of the milk mixture. Stir with a wide-opening straw, then serve.</li>

        <h2>Red braised pork belly</h2>
            <h3>Origin: Hunan</h3>

            <img src="images/red-braised-pork-belly.jpeg" width="400" alt="Red braised pork belly">
            <p>A popular cut of meat, pork belly is treasured by many great cuisines around the world. Containing a high percentage of fat, it needs to be cooked in a particular way to reduce its greasy taste.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Pork Belly</li>
                <li>Shaoxing Rice Wine</li>
                <li>Soy Sauce</li>
                <li>Aromatic & Spices</li>
                <li>Rock Sugar</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Recipe Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Put the pork belly cubes into a pot filled with cold water then turn on the heat to high. </li>
                <li>After blanching, put the pork into a clean pot then pour in Shaoxing rice wine and hot water (barely cover the meat). Add light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, ginger, star anise and bay leaves.</li>
                <li>Turn on the heat to bring the liquid to a full boil. Cover with a lid and turn down the heat. Leave to simmer for at least one hour. Poke one piece of meat with a chopstick to check the tenderness.</li>
                <li>Add rock sugar (or regular white sugar) to the braising liquid and leave to boil fiercely. As the sugar melts and the water evaporates, the broth will dramatically reduce its volume and become thicker.</li>
